This project implements a miniature programming language using Lex (flex) and Yacc (bison). 
It demonstrates the foundational concepts of compiler design, including lexical analysis, syntax parsing, semantic checks, and intermediate code generation.

Technologies Used
Lex (flex) – For tokenizing source code (lexical analysis)

Yacc (bison) – For parsing and syntax analysis

C – Backend integration and semantic logic
